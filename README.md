## Professional Summary

SOC-focused cybersecurity analyst with hands-on lab experience in SIEM monitoring, alert triage, Windows Event Log and Sysmon analysis, phishing investigation, and Sigma-based detection development. Built and maintained a virtual SOC environment in Splunk to validate detection logic, investigate suspicious activity, and produce investigation notes suitable for analyst handoff.

---

## Core Technical Capabilities

- SIEM monitoring, alert triage, and incident queue prioritization
- Windows Event Log and Sysmon telemetry analysis
- IOC extraction, enrichment, and validation workflows
- Phishing analysis and email header investigation
- Sigma rule analysis/writing and false-positive reduction
- MITRE ATT&CK mapping and detection gap tracking
- Incident documentation and response recommendations

## Portfolio Project Hierarchy

### 1) vSOC-Lab

Self-built virtual SOC environment for enterprise-style monitoring and investigation workflows.

- Focus areas: log ingestion, indexing, triage workflow, incident documentation
- Tooling: Splunk, Windows telemetry, Sysmon
- Outcome: repeatable detection validation and investigation process

### 2) Sigma Detection Collection

Structured detection repository organized by ATT&CK-relevant behavior.

- Focus areas: execution, persistence, and high-confidence detections
- Method: test detection logic against Windows telemetry in lab
- Outcome: practical rule tuning and false-positive analysis

### 3) Incident Response Case Studies

Documented investigations from alert to containment recommendations.

- Focus areas: triage timeline, evidence review, root cause analysis
- Cases: encoded PowerShell activity, registry run-key persistence, service creation abuse
- Outcome: clear, escalation-ready investigation records

### 4) pfSense Firewall Lab

Virtual firewall lab for traffic-control and segmentation behavior testing.

- Focus areas: policy logic, filtering outcomes, baseline hardening
- Outcome: improved understanding of network-layer detection context
